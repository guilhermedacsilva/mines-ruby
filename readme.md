## Synopsis

This is a Mine game written in Ruby language. I developed it for studying purposes. It does not have graphical interface, only text. It was designed to run on linux, because of the colored terminal sintax.

## Development

It gave me a good undestood of array methods, tests, mixins and metaprogramming. In 'lib/util' folder, there are several classes/modules for: generate boolean instance methods, a console menu helper, a forwardable that accepts fixed params to the underlying method, and a file loader.

## Gems used

I only used the Kernel and STDLib. I used Ruby 2.3.1.
In development, I used the rubocop gem for code analysis, but it isn't needed to run.

## Motivation

- Learn the Ruby way of coding programs: project structure, tests, blocks, etc.
- Use the TDD development style and API.

## Installation

ruby bin/play.rb

## Tests

Just run rake on root folder.

## License

MIT license. Have fun!
